CGs, in the vocabulary of Finnegan Southey's Notio program use these fundamental objects:

Node -- a base object
Concept -- extends Node
Relation -- extends Node
Graph -- extends nothing.

A Graph is a container of Nodes and Relations.

A CG looks like this:
  [ CAT ] <- ( agent ) <- [ SIT ] -> ( loc ) -> [ MAT ]

Where
	[...] are concepts
	(...) are relations
	
NOTE:
	In topic maps vocabulary, "SIT" is a predicate, but it is used as a concept
	just as TMRM topic maps make topics out of predicates.
	In topic maps vocabulary, "agent" would be a *role*, but here, it is a connective
	relation between concepts.
	
A Concept can have many relations.

OBSERVATIONS
	IN a conceptual graph, it appears that graphs can nest graphs
	Notio's Graph object is only a container of Concepts and Relations
	
	Graphs contain internal Relations
	Graphs can link to other Graphs
	Graphs can contain Graphs (as above)
GOAL
	MAP CG design ideas to topic map design ideas.
	
GAME
	We are defining objects by interface
		Node --> INode
		Concept --> IConcept
		Relation --> IRelation
		Graph --> IGraph
IDEAS
	1- Each time a topic is used as the subject of a concept:
		An IConcept object is made with a Reference to that Proxy
		A IConcept is thus a container of
			TopicReference
			In and Out edges based on Relations
			What else?
				What about provenance, biographies,etc?
	2- It appears that IGraph should extend INode to support nesting graphs
	3- Therefore, an IGraph should be a container of
		INode objects
		IRelation objects
	4- An IRelation object contains
		Reference to the topic which defines (gives identity to) it
		Reference to its source (as in Out edge container)
		Reference to its target (as in In edge container)
		What else?
			What about provenance, biographies, etc?
